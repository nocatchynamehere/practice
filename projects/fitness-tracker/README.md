# Fitness Tracker Application

## 🗂️ Full-Stack Architecture Overview
This project is a full-stack fitness tracking web application built with:

* Flask (Python) for backend routing and business logic

* HTML/CSS web forms for user interaction and data entry

* PostgreSQL for relational data storage

* SQLAlchemy ORM for Python–database communication

* Jinja2 templating for dynamic page rendering*

## 📊 Database Schema
The backend uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage structured fitness and wellness data, including:

* Users

* Measurements (e.g., body fat %, weight, heart rate)

* Workouts and associated Exercises

* Set-level logs (weight lifted, reps, rest intervals)

* Sleep tracking, hydration, and nutrition

## 📁 Files & Resources
* backend/fitness_tracker_schema.sql: Full SQL schema for database creation

* backend/fitness_tracker_schema.dbml: DBML file for visual modeling

* View/edit it on dbdiagram.io

* docs/fitness_tracker_schema.png: ER Diagram preview

* requirements.txt: All Python dependencies for Flask and PostgreSQL integration

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates
This project highlights a range of job-relevant skills, including:

* Flask backend development (routes, form handling, CRUD operations)

* SQL schema design and normalization (including foreign key relationships)

* Frontend templating with Jinja2 and basic HTML/CSS

* Integration with PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy ORM

* Real-world state management via relational data models

* Secure .env file use for managing DB credentials and environment config

* Git version control and repo hygiene (.gitignore, virtualenvs, environment parity)
