### Database Schema

This project uses a PostgreSQL database to store fitness tracker data including:

* Users
* Workouts and exercises
* Set-level logs (reps, weight, rest)
* Sleep, hydration, and nutrition data

The full schema is available in [backend/schema.sql](backend/fitness_tracker_schema.sql)

You can import the DBML file [backend/schema.dbml](backend/fitness_tracker_schema.dbml) 
into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) to view or edit it visually.

An ER diagram is included in [docs/schema.png](docs/fitness_tracker_schema.png)
